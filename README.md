# ScienceQtech Employee Database Analysis and Performance Mapping 


## Project Overview
This project showcases SQL database management and analytics skills applied to an employee performance mapping scenario for ScienceQtech. The queries, stored procedures, and functions built allow for a comprehensive analysis of employee details, project contributions, and performance ratings. MySQL Workbench 8.0 was used to complete these tasks.

## Features
- **Database Creation**: Designed and implemented an employee database by importing datasets.
- **ER Diagram**: Visualized database relationships and established primary/foreign keys.
- **SQL Queries**: Wrote queries to retrieve employee details, calculate bonuses, rank employees, and more.
- **Views and Stored Procedures**: Created views for filtered data and automated repetitive tasks using stored procedures and functions.
- **Query Optimization**: Used indexing and execution plans to improve query performance.


## Datasets  
The project uses the following tables:  
1. **Employee Record Table**: Contains employee data (ID, name, role, department, salary, etc.).  >> emp_record_table.csv
2. **Project Table**: Details of ongoing and completed projects.  >> proj_table.csv
3. **Data Science Team Table**: Focused data for employees in the data science team. >> data_science_team.csv


## Key Tasks  
1. Imported datasets into the database.  
2. Created an ER diagram and established relationships.  
3. Generated employee performance and project-related queries, such as:  
   - Fetching details of employees based on performance ratings.  
   - Concatenating employee names for specific departments.  
   - Ranking employees by experience.  
   - Calculating salaries and bonuses.  
4. Built a stored function to match job profiles with organizational standards.  
5. Enhanced query performance with indexing.
